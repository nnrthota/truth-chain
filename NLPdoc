Abstract:
This code takes in url of a newspaper or news website from the user through a website and then uses webscraping and Natural Language Processing to get the articles and generate summary statements of each article. After this each article summary is stored in a cloud database.
Explanation:
The whole process happens through the following steps-
1. The url is taken from the user through a website. To access the website on localhost after running the code go to http://0.0.0.0:8080/truthchain .
2. The url is then used to build a "newspaper" using the newspaper library.
3. Articles are extracted from the news paper and summary statements are built.
4. The summary statements are then stored in a cloud database(we are using MLAB here).
